Algorithm Followed:

Build a Trie from the given products.
main_list = [[
For each prefix of the word to be searched, find if the prefix exists in Trie:
  if prefix not found:
    return False and listwords = empty
  elif prefix found and last node has no further children:
    return False and listwords = [prefix]
  else:
    return True and listwords = []
    for the lastnode of the prefix found in the trie, recursively print all the possible words.
      sort the returned list of words and pick first three words
      Append in the main_list.
 return main_list
